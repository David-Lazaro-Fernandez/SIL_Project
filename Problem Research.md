# Problem Research

## First problem

**The use of the school laboratories can be limited for students**

* Due to the number of groups that need the labs.
* Due to few number of classes assigned to labs.
* Due to the teacher's absence.
* Due to the students that are doing a thesis and need the equipment of the labs.
* Due to energy outages.

This problem continues to increase as the number of students in a school increases.  
Investing in more infrastructure is time-consuming and costly.

### Second problem

**Online testing and education led to a rise in cheating**

* The use of the Internet during the exam to search for solutions.
* Copy-Paste from notes saved in the device.

This problem spiked during COVID online learning.  
Monitor students during online testing is hard.
